                       THE ANT AND THE CRICKET

   Once upon a time... one hot summer, a cricket sang cheerfully on the branch
of a tree, while down below, a long line of ants struggled damely under the
weight of their load of grains; and between one song and the next, the cricket
spoke to the ants. "Why are you working so hard? Come into the shade, away from
the sun, and sing a song with me." But the tireless ants went on with the
work...
   And so all summer, the cricket sang while the ants laboured. But the days
turned into weeks and the weeks into months. Autumn came, the leaves began to
fall and the cricket left the bare tree. The grass too was turning thun and
yellow. One morning, the cricket woke shivering with cold. An early frost
tinged the fields with white
   "Who's there? Who is it?"
   "It's me - the cricket. I'm cold and hungry, with no roof over my head."
   "The cricket? Yes! I remember you. And what were you doing all summer
while we were getting ready for winter?"
   "Me? I was singing and filling the whole earth and sky with my song!"
   "Singing, eh?" said the ant. "Well, try dancing now!"
